# Rclone Configuration Tools

This repository contains tools for setting up and managing rclone-based file synchronization and logging solutions.

## Scripts Overview

### 1. bootstrap-bisync.sh
Automatically sets up **automatic file synchronization** between two cloud storage locations (like Google Drive, OneDrive, Amazon S3, etc.) using rclone. Think of it as a "set it and forget it" solution that keeps your files in sync across different cloud services.

### 2. bootstrap-mezmo-agent.sh
Automatically configures the **Mezmo (formerly LogDNA) agent** to collect and send rclone logs to the Mezmo observability platform. This provides centralized log management, monitoring, and alerting for your file synchronization operations.

## What does it do?

1. **Creates a scheduled task** that runs automatically at regular intervals
2. **Synchronizes files** between two cloud storage locations
3. **Keeps backups** of any files that get deleted or changed
4. **Handles conflicts** automatically (newer files win)
5. **Monitors the sync process** and logs everything for troubleshooting

## Prerequisites

### For bootstrap-bisync.sh:
- **Linux system** (Ubuntu, CentOS, etc.)
- **rclone installed** (version 1.68.0 or newer)
- **rclone configured** with your cloud storage accounts
- **Administrator access** (sudo privileges)

### For bootstrap-mezmo-agent.sh:
- **Linux system** (Ubuntu, CentOS, etc.)
- **Mezmo ingestion key** (from your Mezmo account)
- **Administrator access** (sudo privileges)
- **Internet connectivity** (to download and install the agent)

## How to use

### Basic usage

```bash
sudo ./bootstrap-bisync.sh \
  --path1 "onedrive@account:/FolderName" \
  --path2 "s3@account:bucket/FolderName"
```

### What the parameters mean

- **`--path1`**: First cloud storage location (source)
- **`--path2`**: Second cloud storage location (destination)
- **`--client`**: Optional name for this sync job (defaults to folder name)
- **`--interval`**: How often to sync (default: 5 minutes)
- **`--user`**: Which user account to run the sync under

### Examples

**Sync OneDrive to S3:**
```bash
sudo ./bootstrap-bisync.sh \
  --path1 "onedrive@work:/Documents" \
  --path2 "s3@backup:mybucket/Documents"
```

**Sync with custom settings:**
```bash
sudo ./bootstrap-bisync.sh \
  --path1 "gdrive@personal:/Photos" \
  --path2 "dropbox@backup:/Photos" \
  --client "PhotoBackup" \
  --interval "1h"
```

### Setting up Mezmo logging

**Basic setup (interactive):**
```bash
sudo ./bootstrap-mezmo-agent.sh
```

**Non-interactive setup with environment variables:**
```bash
sudo MEZMO_KEY="your-ingestion-key" ./bootstrap-mezmo-agent.sh
```

**Custom tags setup:**
```bash
sudo MEZMO_KEY="your-key" MEZMO_TAGS="rclone,production,backup" ./bootstrap-mezmo-agent.sh
```

## What happens after setup?

### bootstrap-bisync.sh:
1. **Script creates** a scheduled task that runs automatically
2. **First run** does a full sync (this may take a while)
3. **Subsequent runs** only sync changes (much faster)
4. **Logs are created** in `/var/log/rclone/[client-name]/`
5. **Backups are stored** in `_bisync_backups` folders on both locations

### bootstrap-mezmo-agent.sh:
1. **Agent is installed** automatically if not present
2. **Configuration is created** in `/etc/logdna/config.yaml`
3. **Systemd service is configured** with proper overrides
4. **Agent starts automatically** and begins collecting logs
5. **Logs are sent to Mezmo** platform for centralized monitoring

## Managing your sync jobs

### Check status
```bash
# Check if the timer is running
systemctl status rclone-bisync@[client-name].timer

# Check the last sync job
systemctl status rclone-bisync@[client-name].service

# View recent logs
journalctl -u rclone-bisync@[client-name].service -n 50
```

### View sync logs
```bash
# Real-time log monitoring
tail -f /var/log/rclone/[client-name]/bisync.log

# Initial sync logs
tail -f /var/log/rclone/[client-name]/bisync-init.log
```

### Stop/start sync jobs
```bash
# Stop automatic syncing
sudo systemctl stop rclone-bisync@[client-name].timer

# Start automatic syncing again
sudo systemctl start rclone-bisync@[client-name].timer

# Run a sync job manually
sudo systemctl start rclone-bisync@[client-name].service
```

### Managing Mezmo agent

**Check status:**
```bash
# Check if the agent is running
systemctl status logdna-agent

# View recent logs
journalctl -u logdna-agent -n 50
```

**Control the agent:**
```bash
# Stop the agent
sudo systemctl stop logdna-agent

# Start the agent
sudo systemctl start logdna-agent

# Restart the agent
sudo systemctl restart logdna-agent
```

### Graceful shutdown
The services are configured to stop gracefully, allowing rclone to complete current operations:
- **SIGINT handling**: Services respond to interrupt signals properly
- **Timeout protection**: 2-minute grace period for clean shutdown
- **Data safety**: Prevents corruption during service stops

## Safety features

### bootstrap-bisync.sh:
- **Automatic backups**: Deleted files are saved before removal
- **Conflict resolution**: Newer files automatically win conflicts
- **Error recovery**: Failed syncs are retried automatically
- **Health checks**: Script verifies both locations are accessible
- **Lock protection**: Prevents multiple sync jobs from running simultaneously
- **Graceful shutdown**: Services stop cleanly without data corruption

### bootstrap-mezmo-agent.sh:
- **Secure configuration**: Configuration file has restricted permissions (600)
- **Automatic installation**: Installs agent if not present on supported systems
- **Environment isolation**: Prevents conflicts with existing configurations
- **Service validation**: Verifies agent starts successfully before completing

## Troubleshooting

### Common issues

#### bootstrap-bisync.sh:
1. **"rclone not found"**: Install rclone first
2. **"Permission denied"**: Make sure you're running with sudo
3. **"Config not found"**: Run `rclone config` to set up your accounts
4. **Sync not starting**: Check if the timer is enabled and running

#### bootstrap-mezmo-agent.sh:
1. **"ingestion key vazia"**: Provide a valid Mezmo ingestion key
2. **"n√£o sei instalar automaticamente"**: Install logdna-agent package manually
3. **Agent not starting**: Check systemd logs and verify configuration
4. **Logs not appearing in Mezmo**: Verify internet connectivity and key validity

### Getting help

- Check the logs in `/var/log/rclone/[client-name]/`
- Use `systemctl status` commands to see what's happening
- Ensure both cloud storage locations are accessible
- Verify your rclone configuration is correct

## Advanced options

### Non-interactive mode
```bash
sudo ./bootstrap-bisync.sh --non-interactive \
  --path1 "source:path" \
  --path2 "dest:path" \
  --client "JobName" \
  --interval "30min"
```

### Recreate existing jobs
```bash
sudo ./bootstrap-bisync.sh \
  --path1 "source:path" \
  --path2 "dest:path" \
  --recreate
```

### Custom backup locations
```bash
sudo ./bootstrap-bisync.sh \
  --path1 "source:path" \
  --path2 "dest:path" \
  --bkp1 "source:/custom/backup/path" \
  --bkp2 "dest:/custom/backup/path"
```

### Mezmo agent customization

**Environment variables:**
- **`MEZMO_KEY`**: Your Mezmo ingestion key
- **`MEZMO_TAGS`**: Custom tags for log categorization (default: "rclone,bisync")

**Configuration file location:**
- **`/etc/logdna/config.yaml`**: Main configuration file
- **`/etc/systemd/system/logdna-agent.service.d/override.conf`**: Systemd overrides

## How it works (simplified)

### bootstrap-bisync.sh:
1. **Script analyzes** your cloud storage locations
2. **Creates system service** that runs rclone bisync
3. **Sets up timer** to run the service automatically
4. **First run** does complete file comparison and sync
5. **Ongoing runs** only sync new/changed/deleted files
6. **Everything is logged** for monitoring and troubleshooting

### bootstrap-mezmo-agent.sh:
1. **Script collects** your Mezmo ingestion key
2. **Installs agent** automatically if not present
3. **Creates configuration** with secure settings
4. **Configures systemd** service with proper overrides
5. **Starts agent** and validates it's working
6. **Logs are collected** and sent to Mezmo platform

## Support

This script is designed to be self-contained and reliable. If you encounter issues:

1. Check the logs first
2. Verify your rclone configuration
3. Ensure both storage locations are accessible
4. Check system resources (disk space, network connectivity)

The script includes extensive error handling and will provide clear messages about what went wrong and how to fix it.
